# Expedition infantry: tactical design and research

Scope: the opt-in CMU scavenger controller, on expedition and ordinary maps. Decisions remain server-side;
native steering, firearms, physics, factions and medical do-afters execute actions.

## Sources and adaptations

- [Jeff Orkin, Three States and a Plan: The A.I. of F.E.A.R., GDC 2006](https://www.gamedevs.org/uploads/three-states-plan-ai-of-fear.pdf).
  The useful architectural ideas are shared working memory, action preconditions, recovery
  after failed actions, and separating individual survival from squad coordination.
  Our controller keeps remembered contacts, reserved cover/peek positions and a short
  failed-destination memory. Squad attack slots never override injury, suppression or
  player possession. A bounded GOAP planner now selects executable local actions; the squad
  coordinator separately reserves a covering shooter for a mover and monitors their continued readiness.

- [Arjen Beij and Remco Straatman, Killzone: Dynamic Procedural Tactics, GDCE 2005](https://www.guerrilla-games.com/media/News/Files/gdce05_killzone_ai.pdf).
  Position evaluation combines range, exposure and movement cost. For our generated maps,
  candidates must pass traversable-ground, fire, leash and live collision checks before scoring.
  Shelters must conceal the guard's width; peeks must clear the body, nearby muzzle corridor
  and direct shot. Distant foliage beside the aim point can catch stray rounds.
  Scores favor short step-outs, useful range and protection from secondary observed threats.
  Bounded local A* assigns exposure costs, then native steering follows the chosen waypoints.

- [Microsoft, Halo 2 AI Behavior List](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/halo-master-chief-collection/h2/ai/aibehaviorlist).
  Its documented cover-peek and self-preservation behaviors inform immediate withdrawal
  under pressure and separate watch/search phases after losing contact.
  Our guards suppress their own exposure after perceived hostile shots pass near their
  position, remember a last-seen location briefly, and reassess before leaving shelter.

## Current behavior

1. Observe at 150 ms intervals and store a last-seen coordinate for six seconds. Compare
   usable shots at the four nearest visible targets, the current one and eight directional representatives, retaining the
   current target during a viable volley. Never track an unseen target's current position.
   Retain visible targets through committed movement and utility work, with a 1.5-second
   minimum between ordinary target switches. Brief sight loss holds the stance for 350 ms
   without firing; movement destinations survive contact changes. Healing and reloads are
   not cancelled merely because a different enemy becomes the preferred target.
2. Keep rifles shouldered during combat movement; lower them for actual utility work.
   Initial aim takes 180 ms and peek aim 80 ms, in addition to native weapon readiness.
   Volleys consume real rounds at the weapon's native rate; cover searches wait until the
   volley ends. A first shot starts the full burst window. Recheck geometry and the next
   shot's recoil cone for allied bodies before every shot. A crossing ally pauses fire;
   a persistently blocked lane triggers a deliberate sidestep or withdrawal.
3. Search at most 256 local cells, with an eight-step search radius. Pair an occluded
   shelter with a firing position no more than 3.2 metres away along a clear passage.
4. Move precisely into the firing position, aim briefly and fire the variant's limited volley.
   Hold a productive stance across volleys; return to valid shelter when pressure or a lost lane warrants it.
   Nearby squadmates reserve different positions and stagger
   peeks with local attack slots.
   Stop a peek at usable geometry even when a teammate temporarily blocks firing. Stops
   inside valid shelter tolerate 55 cm of endpoint error, avoiding needless tiny corrections.
   Coverless recovery resumes aim only with a visible target and no active utility action.
5. Hits or visible hostile fire passing within 1.5 metres interrupt exposure. Pressure
   delays the next peek; uncovered guards seek a safe refuge when one is reachable.
6. Wounded guards use their physical three-dose dressing pack while sheltered. They free
   a hand and complete a three-second native medical action. Damage, movement, lost
   safety, incapacitation or player possession cancels treatment.
7. A failed/timed-out movement destination is avoided for eight seconds. A combat move
   with no new 10 cm closest approach to its current waypoint for 1.5 seconds fails early. Pursuit route failures back off for
   one second. Movement checks use body collision rather than bullet-only obstruction;
   clear traversable route segments skip intermediate tile stops. Exposure penalties are capped
   so overlapping enemy lanes do not multiply into prohibitive detours.
   Destroyed cover, changed threat angles and expired contacts invalidate the current plan.

Ordered travel and tactical manoeuvres use the RMC human's 35 cm circular footprint and a
continuous swept corridor, including furniture and barricade collision layers. A* edges use
the actual body radius and smoothed segments prefer 40 cm clearance. Narrow passages retain
individual cell stops; endpoint connections can use the actual radius beside an obstacle.
Endpoint cells use the body's actual start and requested end positions; intermediate tile centres
remain available as waypoints. A failed short connection or stalled leg can use a half-tile detour
with 384 expansions, at most one local search per frame and one attempt per agent every three seconds.
Stall recovery avoids repeating the immediate failed approach. Within the usual
25 cm arrival band, a corner is only dequeued when the next segment is clear from the actual
body position. Otherwise steering approaches within 5 cm of the corner. Validated segments
use native local avoidance without a second navmesh path overriding the selected waypoints.
Only a new closest approach resets stall timing; sideways wall jitter does not. Interrupted
ordered segments retry after 0.5 seconds, while failed searches retain a three-second backoff.
Route budgets remain 256 cells for tactics and 2048 for orders, with one ordered search per frame.

The distances and timers above are tuning choices for this game, not values claimed by
the cited papers. The aim is readable, adaptable opposition with ordinary ammunition and
medical limits.

## Planning, squads, and experience

A bounded GOAP search (128 states) chooses from executable cover, reload, treatment, rescue,
smoke, grenade, flank and attack actions. Each action checks its preconditions again when it
starts and fails on obstruction, interruption or timeout. Movement uses a 256-node local A*
search with danger costs and real collision checks. Physical magazines, dressings and grenades
are finite inventory items. A native pulling joint drags critical squadmates into shelter.

Equipped squad headsets share a frozen observation after a short delay, within 40 metres.
Reports retain their original reception deadline when further reports arrive, so a busy
channel cannot keep delaying the reaction. Accepted snapshots expire after twelve seconds
and do not reveal an unseen target's current position. Recent visual contact and active
survival/utility actions take precedence. Recipients respond silently and approach the reported area in at most eight-metre
steps with separate destinations. This keeps each step inside the local search bound even
when the report came from farther away. Responders remain within their guard leash and
wait near the reported location if they find no enemy; expired reports release the response.
Pursuit destinations are retained until meaningful contact movement or arrival, with a
one-second replanning interval and a wider stop band at rifle range.

Squads have separate
position reservations, staggered attack slots and one flanker at a time. Aggressive, steady
and cautious dispositions respond to pressure, wounds and nearby support.
Guards fighting different opponents within the same eight-metre contact area count as
nearby support for morale and attack slots. Actual covering fire requires a loaded gun which
successfully fired within 1.5 seconds, a perceived target and a safe firing lane; a state named
Aim alone cannot authorize movement.

## Squad execution and navigation

Optional cover changes, flanks, non-emergency healing moves and ordinary rescue approaches reserve
one stationary shooter per mover. Support and marksman roles are preferred. An escort already
covering medical work cannot take a movement assignment. Readiness is checked again during movement:
empty or lost guns, blocked lanes, knockdown, player control, rushes, danger and emergency injury
release the commitment. The mover stops optional travel and returns fire. Commitments last at most
six seconds; emergency escapes and lone guards do not wait for nonexistent support.
Covering shooters retain their visible contact during target selection, and medics defer starting
optional work while assigned to cover a mover. Empty or obstructed firing states do not monopolize
the cover-exposure slots. Non-emergency reloads may reserve a shooter when hard shelter is unavailable;
the native interruptible action still consumes a compatible carried magazine or shell.

New contact retains the original order route and up to two metres of its current leg for at most
1.25 seconds, provided body clearance, threat exposure and melee separation still permit it.
Support/marksman roles settle when they have a useful shot. Firing remains independent of travel,
including a guard waiting in a queue. After combat, the retained route is revalidated from the actual
position and rebuilt if necessary. Target changes alone do not cancel an active physical flank.

A useful firing position receives a role-configured commitment (two to six seconds in the supplied
roles). Subsequent cover candidates need a material improvement after travel cost, exposure, range
and a shelter bonus. Ordinary bursts do not automatically force a return into cover. Invalid geometry,
incoming hits at shelter, blocked lanes, rushes and grenades still override the position commitment.

Each traveller advertises a short corridor. Followers queue behind a leading body; opposing traffic
in narrow passages uses stable request time and entity-ID tie breaking. A yielding guard physically
steps into a reachable passing pocket. Waiting pauses the ordinary stall clock, but after five seconds
the guard replans around a temporarily blocked body instead of extending its queue forever. This
coordinates individual bounded routes; it is not a shared flow field or a guarantee of deadlock-free
multi-agent pathfinding. Hard collision clearance stays at the native body radius.

A visible flank selects the closest viable responder, biased toward skirmishers and away from support
gunners. At most one responder, or two with six nearby members, is selected for that contact. Existing
responders count toward the limit; covering commitments are retained. Melee emergencies still override
target distribution. No enemy position is supplied to a member who cannot see it.

The new roles, compositions, command completion and squad coordination were built and their YAML
parsed without tests or in-game verification. Earlier runtime measurements do not validate this revision.
Manual verification still required:

1. Spawn `cmu-expedition-ai here 6 fireteam` on a colony grid and an expedition. Tab-complete the
   returned squad ID, orders, styles and faction lists, including a second comma-separated faction.
2. Order movement through a one-tile L-shaped corridor in both directions with two friendly squads.
   Check distinct endpoints, queue/yield diagnostics, passing pockets, timeout/repath and arrival.
   Repeat on a rotated grid, with a stationary blocker, RMC water and a moving crate.
3. Make contact mid-patrol in dense trees. Confirm fire during the retained leg and during queueing,
   then resumption of the original order. Block the covering shooter's lane, empty/disarm its gun,
   knock it down and take player control; each must interrupt the dependent manoeuvre.
4. Sustain frontal fire and add a lateral attacker. Confirm only selected responders turn, the front
   keeps receiving fire, useful positions remain held and exposed shelters are rejected. Add a melee rush.
5. Spawn each new role alone, expend its primary ammunition, reload in safety and verify finite
   reserves and backup switching. Interrupt shotgun shell insertion with damage and movement.
6. Record route/search time with six and twelve guards under simultaneous contact; inspect covered
   moves, support-loss interruptions, traffic state and moving-shot counters. No cost or balance result
   is claimed from compilation.

Follow-up verification for equipment and ammunition exhaustion:

- Spawn `cmu-expedition-ai here 9 mixed` and confirm complete clothing, packs and exactly one initial
  primary per member. The skirmisher must have an MP5 without an inherited scout rifle or duplicate supplies.
- Keep nearby friendly squads in contact for a minute. Expect at most three audible contact callouts
  across those squads, and one for a continuously reported unchanged target; received/accepted
  report counters should continue increasing between callouts.
  Remove/disable headsets, use incompatible channels, leave the map or radio range, and verify that silent
  reports stop as well. A radio report preserves the interrupted order route.
- Empty the primary at long range with a loaded pistol in the pack. Confirm the pistol is drawn and the
  guard seeks its usable range. Exhaust both guns, provide shelter or an actual covering shooter, then
  check reload progress and interruption when the shooter loses its lane, is disarmed or is knocked down.
- Deplete all carried ammunition. Check safe last-resort grenades/smoke, exclusive retrieval of a loose
  loaded gun within four metres, rejection of living inventories/hidden/blocked guns, five-second cancellation and
  native melee only when an enemy reaches contact distance. Orders, knockdown and player possession
  must release retrieval claims. Existing grenade and rocket limits remain in force.

Grenades are considered on initial contact with multiple enemies, or as a last resort after
repeated failed exposures or severe pressure. Reservations cap a squad decision at two
throwers in a two-second window; the squad then waits 35 seconds. Smoke for withdrawals and casualty recovery
shares that budget. Throw preparation rechecks the friendly blast area and only primes a
grenade after a successful physical throw.

Bounded aggregate exposure/flank outcomes are persisted by biome and disposition (or the
`Ordinary` environment for maps without expedition metadata) to
`/cmu-expedition-experience.json` in server user data. They adjust next-round costs within
0.75–1.25. This is modest outcome adaptation, not neural training or player-specific profiling.

## Operator controls

`cmu-expedition-ai <map|here> [1..12] [mixed|regular|poor|rich|scout|assault|support|marksman|rocketeer|specialists]` creates a new squad
and prints its ID. `here` works from a body or observer over ground on ordinary maps too.
Numeric expedition IDs select the recovery objective. Variants have distinct finite gear,
armor and combat tuning; see [the command and variant guide](README.md#integration-boundary).
`cmu-expedition-orders <map> <squad> move <x> <y>` moves it to spread positions.
`cmu-expedition-orders here <squad> move` uses the administrator's current position.
Replace `move` with `guard` to establish a guard area and entrench after 20 quiet seconds.
Only that explicit order authorizes construction; spawning a squad does not. Optional guard facing
(`auto`, `north`, `east`, `south`, `west`) follows the coordinates, or follows `guard` with `here`.
Auto scores open approaches. Build positions remain within two tiles of the assigned guard anchor,
with reserved spacing, a forward firing lane, a rear escape and at least one lateral exit.
Guards use their real shovel to dig and build a mound, or nearby metal to build a native
barricade. Construction stops on contact, injury, possession or a new order. One completed
fortification per guard order avoids filling every nearby tile indefinitely.

Add 2-8 locations with `patrol-add` in place of `move`, then issue `patrol-start` without
coordinates. `patrol-stop` holds the current area; `patrol-clear` also removes the points.
Combat interrupts travel and the patrol resumes after contact expires. `move`/`guard` replace
the active patrol. Explicit orders follow bounded, traversable routes (2,048 cells, at most one search
per update), rechecking live obstruction and retrying blocked travel after three seconds.
`cmu-expedition-ai-status <map>` displays progress and blocked orders. Long or maze-like routes
may need intermediate waypoints. Continuous ground can connect touching grids; cross-level orders
use native CMU ladder/stair chains with bounded retries. See [SQUADS.md](SQUADS.md) for persistent
plans, route sharing, straggler recovery and traversal limits. Usable closed doors
are planned as portals, then opened with native interaction and access checks at the doorway.

Door planning checks native access, bolts, welds, power and door-specific opening rules once per
agent/door per frame. Physical clearance, spawning, medical stances and peeks still treat closed
doors as solid. Route smoothing retains full body clearance around door frames. Agents approach
the first usable door on a leg, request opening once within interaction range, and wait for actual
collision clearance before continuing. Opening/closing animations suspend the ordinary stuck
timer for a bounded 2–8 seconds; a rejected or timed-out door is avoided for eight seconds while
the original order is replanned. Agents don't close doors behind squadmates. This does not add
key acquisition, forced entry, remote button operation, or vaulting. The status command reports
the current door decision, successful open requests and failures.

Vision through windows is separate from movement and projectile collision. Clear RMC/full-tile
and tagged directional windows allow target acquisition; enabled occluders, walls and smoke
still block sight. Rifle lanes permit firing at a visible enemy through destructible panes:
normal rounds first damage/break the glass, then reach the enemy. Shattered RMC frames retain
their native untargeted-projectile pass-through. Indestructible glass blocks fire, while breakable
glass/frames cannot certify safe medical shelter. Friendly-fire cone checks remain in force on
both sides of the pane. Grenade paths and rocket blast/backblast checks keep their stricter
physical obstruction rules.

Door/window runtime verification (not yet run):

1. Order six guards through single and paired RMC doors on an ordinary colony map, then patrol
   back through auto-closing doors. Confirm they open from either side, queue, resume their
   original destination, and never toggle an opening/open door closed.
2. Repeat with denied access, missing power, bolts, welds and a door blocked mid-route. Provide
   an alternate corridor. Confirm rerouting/backoff; restore access/power and check retry. Hold
   an opening animation blocked beyond eight seconds and confirm no perpetual waiting loop.
3. Interrupt door travel with enemy contact. Confirm return fire through a real clear lane,
   no fire through an opaque closed door, and resumption of the order after contact ends.
4. Fight through full-tile RMC and directional windows, then their broken frames. Confirm native
   glass damage/ammo consumption, continued fire after breakage, and no walking through glass.
   Repeat with indestructible/tinted panes, a wall or shutter behind glass, smoke and a friendly
   crossing either side: these must still prevent the corresponding sight/shot.
5. Record route/search timings with six guards traversing several doorways under simultaneous
   contact. Door permission checks are cached per frame; opening does not restart the route
   search on each think or prevent covering fire while waiting.

Ground checks use current grid tiles, fire entities and hard body collision. Shallow/deep RMC
water is traversable with native contact slowdown; sensor fixtures do not block body clearance.
Generated terrain adds cliff and map bounds, but ordinary maps need no expedition component. Local cover,
flanking and rescue use the same ground checks, including grids with negative tile coordinates.

Use `style Aggressive`, `style Steady` or `style Cautious` to tune a squad. `target GOVFOR,OPFOR`
sets explicit target factions; `friendly GOVFOR` protects that faction. `default` restores
native faction targeting or removes the friendly overrides. Friendly overrides take priority;
these commands never change the server's global faction relations.

`cmu-expedition-ai-status here` also shows radio reports received/accepted, the latest
decision and the current approach point. `maintaining-current-action`, `outside-guard-area`,
`stale-report`, `support-route-blocked` and `watching-reported-area` explain why hearing a
callout may not result in immediate movement. Acknowledgements do not broadcast contacts.

## Disarms, rushes and sustained pressure

Each guard remembers the rifle it physically held. After native stun/knockdown and stand-up
finish, it selects a rifle still in either hand or picks its dropped rifle up through normal
hands and interaction checks. Recovery approaches are limited to six metres, visible loose
weapons and bounded traversable routes. Held, stored, hidden, deleted or anchored weapons are not
retrieved. A close rush interrupts a distant retrieval, but permits picking up a reachable
rifle. Failed pickups/routes have retry delays; ammunition is never replaced by recovery.

Visible xenos (including neomorphs) and unarmed melee opponents trigger escape inside the six-metre
standoff, including their projected approach over 0.65 seconds. Shooting assignments remain separate:
allies spread fire with a short 0.6-second commitment, while an imminent contact inside 2.2 projected
metres overrides it. Up to fourteen short escape corridors are scored against the closest six visible
melee threats, brief last-seen snapshots, terrain, hazards and actual/planned friendly crowding.
Committed escape steps continue while the rifle fires through the normal aim, ammo, fire-rate,
wield and friendly-fire checks. There is no speed boost or guaranteed escape from faster aliens.
If trapped, the guard returns fire. Up to eight frozen melee positions persist for three seconds
through smoke or sight loss, without updating hidden transforms/velocities or permitting blind shots.
Smoke is withheld while melee threats are visible/recent. Observable incoming xeno/biomorph projectiles
can trigger a bounded lateral dodge; short-lived spray and persistent acid tiles also inform navigation.
Hazard escape may cross the unsafe starting patch for at most 1.5 metres, but cannot re-enter hazards
after reaching safety. It retains full body collision, native movement speed and native shot constraints.

Cover anchors are rechecked against all known threats before use and at volley completion.
A hit while waiting at an anchor invalidates that location even when geometry reports it
sheltered. Invalid cover is avoided for eight seconds. Exposed guards can fire regardless of
squad exposure slots. Ordinary suppression allows at least two return shots before cutting
a volley short, and repeated suppression cannot extend the shelter pause indefinitely.
Critical injury still permits immediate withdrawal. If no real shelter exists, an armed
guard keeps fighting rather than travelling home to wait in the open. Treatment/reload
safety also requires a brief break in actual damage.

Cover/peek reservations and physical squad spacing prevent multiple guards selecting nearly
the same stance. A crowded exposed pair yields one guard between volleys, at most once every
three seconds. Escape destinations are reserved too; physical bodies in other squads are
avoided without sharing their future-position reservations.

Idle fortification has an explicit preparation state. Retry timers do not lower rifles,
and tools are only prepared after a guard order when usable ground or metal is present. Directional
RMC barricades permit outward fire; their probabilistic incoming block is not hard shelter for medicine.
The survival and fieldcraft lines in
`cmu-expedition-ai-status here` reports weapon recovery, escape decisions, invalidated cover
and preparation/work state.

## Multiple attackers

Target selection includes the nearest four enemies, the current target and representatives
from eight attack directions. A recent visible shooter gets higher priority; other squadmates'
fresh firing commitments discourage piling onto one ordinary target. Existing volleys and
target locks remain stable, and an imminent melee rusher takes priority over target sharing.
Target ranking reuses one nearby-entity lookup for its friendly-fire checks; actual shots
still evaluate live positions and firing lanes.

Position scores use eight weighted attack directions, including nearby enemy concentration
and recent gunfire. Scores are cached within one observation cycle. Shelter and treatment
eligibility continue to check every visible opponent and the remembered primary contact.
An escape from a melee threat also considers exposure to ranged attackers.

After returning fire, a guard under attacks from directions more than sixty degrees apart
can seek a better firing position. At most sixteen short corridors are considered per search,
with a three-second cooldown. The destination must reduce exposure, preserve a firing lane,
avoid melee range and have a traversable, unobstructed approach without higher midpoint exposure.
Nearby engaged squadmates retain covering fire while others move. If no useful position
exists the guard continues fighting. Partial protection never authorizes treatment or a
hidden-cover pause. Longer optional flanks are deferred during crossfire.

Repeated bullets from known shooters update suppression without forcing the complete
decision/search loop to run for every shot. A newly observed shooter can still wake it
immediately. Recent shooters are capped at sixteen and expire after two seconds. These
work bounds have been reviewed in source; runtime performance has not been measured.

`cmu-expedition-ai-status here` adds visible enemy/direction counts, recent shooters,
crossfire status, completed move decisions and squadmates assigned to the current target.

A currently visible shooter firing from more than sixty degrees off the remembered target
bearing can interrupt the ordinary lock. This requires a usable shot from the actual body
position, never an imagined peek, and has a two-second response cooldown. It cancels obsolete
optional repositioning, allows return fire before another plan and preserves active medical
or reload interruption rules. Imminent melee still takes precedence.

## Mobile fire and reaction exceptions

Movement and firing have separate executors. Repositions, peeks, withdrawals, retreats,
investigation and cover/flank plan movement can fire at visible targets without unregistering
steering or waiting for arrival. Opening contact preserves a patrol/investigation's current
movement for up to 750 ms while responding. Moving volleys have their own ammunition counters;
they do not finish a movement action or overwrite its destination.

A newly acquired target, incoming fire or imminent melee bypasses the extra AI aim pause.
Exposed guards under that pressure can resume stationary fire without waiting out an artificial
burst pause; mobile volleys use a 100 ms pressure pause. Native wield delays, recoil, gun rate,
ammunition, visibility and friendly-fire checks remain mandatory. An unfired volley can wait
up to three seconds for native readiness without cycling through another aim/recovery pause.
These exceptions never fire through a reload, grenade preparation, treatment or weapon switch.

## Equipment and ordnance

Guards select from guns physically held, slung in suit storage or carried in their field pack.
Selection considers range, ammunition, role and a preference for keeping the current weapon.
A 250 ms hand transition frees the native wielding hand, then normal hands/inventory APIs
perform the swap. Successful swaps have a two-second commitment; failures back off three seconds.
A one-handed backup can be used while retaining the primary in the other hand if stowing is
blocked. In safety, an empty preferred firearm with compatible spare magazines can be selected
for the existing physical reload action. Disarm recovery takes precedence over optional swaps.

Assault troops use M63 SMGs, support gunners use M41AE2 heavy pulse rifles, marksmen use M4SPR
rifles, and rich scavengers use the modern M41A/2. All except poor scrappers carry backup pistols.
Rocketeers carry an SMG, pistol and one AT-loaded RPG-36 in suit storage. The AI uses a conservative
4.5–6 m window within the rocket's native range. It discards the spent tube and selects a firearm again.
There is no rocket refill. Selection reserves a squad launcher; successful shots impose a
20-second squad rocket cooldown. Clustered enemies or repeatedly punished peeks justify its use.
Close melee rushes favor the ready firearm. Each shot checks splash safety, nearer bodies that
could intercept the rocket, the forward corridor, and the native two-tile cardinal backblast area.

Blast grenades score clusters around at most eight visible directional contacts, with a short
observed-velocity lead. Lone fast targets do not justify an opening grenade; severe pressure
or repeated failed peeks permit a last-resort throw. Live contact and blast safety are checked
again on release. Predicted friendly travel checks the entire swept segment over the fuse,
including known cover/escape destinations. The two-throw/35-second squad discipline remains.

Smoke can screen a threatened reload, withdrawal, crossfire or casualty recovery. Placement
is between the protected position and the enemy, and nearby queued/previous screens prevent
duplicates. Real anchored opaque smoke clouds block the guards' vision beyond point-blank
range; a planned throw does not fabricate concealment. Smoke is not hard cover and does not
authorize exposed medical work. A nearby cloud can conceal an enemy from the throwing squad too.

RMC water keeps native speed penalties. Slow combat movement earns deadline extensions only
when the body makes progress; stall checks remain. Short escape strides scale down with current
movement speed. Cliffs, hard river boundaries, space, fire and grenade hazards stay blocked.

Status output includes flank response count, weapon decisions/switches, rockets, smoke decisions
and shots fired during ordinary travel. These diagnostics support in-game verification below.

## Dedicated field medics

`cmu-expedition-ai here 1 medic` spawns a dedicated medic. `cmu-expedition-ai here 4 medical`
spawns a medic with support, assault and rifle escorts in the same squad. Mixed squads include
a medic as their third member; specialist squads include one as their fifth member. These
roles work on ordinary maps as well as expeditions and respect configured friend/target factions.

Medics triage visible friendly CMU humans within fourteen metres and their existing leash:
critical patients first, then eligible dead, then injured combatants. An exclusive patient claim
prevents two medics or an ordinary rescuer from taking the same casualty. A medic can suspend
travel/combat for care, but injury, rushes, hazards, failed routes and lost cover interrupt it.
Conscious patients keep fighting and are never dragged; movement interrupts a dressing or injection.

Exposed critical/dead patients are pulled through native physics to real shelter before treatment.
The approach requires squad shooters with ammunition and usable sight/firing lanes toward the
known threats. Covering shooters briefly hold their angle between bursts and defer optional
flanks/grenades; their own injury, rush, empty gun and visibility rules remain active. Cover is
rechecked every half-second and losing it for one second cancels an exposed rescue. Conscious
wounded allies can receive care while fighting if both the medical approach and covering fire
remain viable, without crossfire or recent physical wounds. Smoke does not replace these checks.

Each medic carries nine team dressing doses, a separate self-care dressing, six native revival
cocktail injections and a normal finite-charge defibrillator. Dressings use native healing
events; injections use the native hypospray delay and chemical transfer. An existing dose of
any ingredient prevents another cocktail injection. Dead patients are prepared with dressings
when the native defibrillator analysis says more treatment is needed, then shocked through the
normal powered device API with the native recommended energy setting. Heart eligibility, rot,
permanent death, clothing restrictions, cooldowns, charge consumption and native effects remain in force. Treatment continues after
revival when useful supplies remain. Each intervention is bounded to 45 seconds, six treatment
actions and two shocks before reassessment; blocked patients have a short retry backoff.

This is field stabilization, extraction and eligible revival. It does not perform surgery,
replace organs/limbs, transfuse blood or recover permanently unrevivable bodies. Player possession
returns all decisions to the player. Medical status reports patient, decision, covering fire,
treatments, actual shocks, revivals and extractions.

## Verification

Manual medical verification (not run; build and YAML validation only):

1. Spawn `cmu-expedition-ai here 4 medical` on both map types. Wound one escort while it fires,
   then put another in critical condition in exposed ground. Confirm covering fire, native
   pulling, sheltered treatment, physical supply use and returning to previous squad orders.
2. Repeat with opposing shooters, loss of a covering ally, a rushing alien, a grenade, interrupted
   pulling, blocked corridors, exhausted supplies, a moving patient and medic knockdown/death.
   Claims, held tools, medical do-afters and pulls must be released without another free dose.
3. Provide an eligible dead patient, one above the revival damage threshold, a rotten/permanent
   corpse, missing/nonfunctional heart, blocked clothing and an empty battery. Confirm preparation,
   actual charge use, eligible revival and follow-up care; failed attempts must remain bounded.
4. Have two medics and a player treat the same friendly patient. Confirm one AI claim, no repeated
   cocktail dosing over existing chemicals, and no interference with a possessed medic's actions.
5. Use `cmu-expedition-ai-status here` throughout and inspect medical counters. Runtime behavior
   and search cost still require in-game verification; compilation does not demonstrate these outcomes.

Fixtures exercise real weapon fire, lane safety, corner peeks, treatment interruption,
magazine exhaustion, radio snapshots, physical casualty pulling, grenade preparation,
six-guard squads, guard construction, generated terrain and moving connected player bodies.
The six-guard fixture reports candidate-search timing and completed physical flanks.
These are engine simulations; final combat balance still needs human multiplayer playtesting.

The responsiveness, squad variants, patrols and ordinary-map support in the follow-up were
compiled without running tests, as requested. Previous fixture results do not validate these
changes. In-game verification should include multiple squads in dense vegetation, peeks beside
walls, each loadout's ammunition/reload behavior, and interrupted/resumed patrols on both an
ordinary colony grid and an expedition. Verify blocked waypoints, water crossing and fire avoidance,
incapacitation and player possession, and record search cost with simultaneous contacts.

The survival/suppression follow-up is also build-only; no tests or in-game checks were run.
Verify disarm and knockdown with the rifle underfoot and several tiles away, a stolen/stored
rifle, missing hands, and a revived guard. Rush a squad with moving xenos/neomorphs around trees
and corners, then retreat out of sight. Check fire during escape, no blind shots, no pursuit
into the remembered melee gap, water crossing, fire avoidance and behavior when no escape exists.
Keep firing while advancing on a squad: guards must return shots between withdrawals and
reject an exposed or penetrable shelter instead of repeatedly waiting there. Check crowded
groups and friendly-fire lanes. Spawn `cmu-expedition-ai here 5 rich` on both dirt and indoor
flooring and confirm that spawning alone never starts construction; then issue an explicit guard order.

For the multiple-attacker follow-up, use two or more hostile riflemen from opposite sides,
then a larger group from one side and a flanker from another. Add an alien rush during the
firefight. Check divided targets, rusher priority, fire during short crossfire moves and
continued fighting when no better stance exists. Verify that some squadmates keep firing
while others move and that brief sight loss does not reveal hidden targets. Repeat with
six guards under automatic fire and record search timings; no runtime cost claim is made
from the build alone. This follow-up was compiled without running tests or in-game checks.

Manual verification for equipment, water and mobile fire (not yet run):

1. Spawn `cmu-expedition-ai here 4 specialists`, then `cmu-expedition-ai here 5 rich`.
   Confirm gear, finite magazines, safe swaps, pistol use when crowded/out of primary ammo,
   and no idle wield cycle. Disarm and knock down each role; check native recovery and possession.
2. Order a patrol through shallow/deep RMC water and across a catwalk on both map types.
   Check native slowdown, continued progress, blocked hard boundaries/cliffs and fire avoidance.
3. Enter a walking patrol's sight, strafe, flank and fire automatically. Verify shots before
   arrival/stopping, no repeated aim reset, return fire during retreats/peeks, and no firing
   during treatment/reload/throw/switch. Inspect the travelling-shot counter in status.
4. Present clustered enemies at 7–9 m, then move allies through the intended blast zone during
   preparation. Confirm useful throws, cancellation when unsafe and at most two per 35-second
   decision. Apply crossfire or expose a casualty: confirm smoke placement, no duplicate screen,
   actual cloud-based sight loss and no automatic healing in exposed smoke.
5. Present a cluster at 5–6 m to a rocketeer. Repeat with a friendly behind the tube, a nearer
   intercepting body, a blocked corridor and a rushing alien. Confirm held unsafe shots, one
   actual rocket, native wield/backblast effects, a discarded spent tube, firearm return and
   the 20-second squad rocket cooldown. Launchers have no reload supply in these loadouts.
6. Generate an expedition and confirm one short GOVFOR ARES priority assignment when the LZ
   opens. Use the status command during all scenarios and record six-guard search cost.

Manual verification for corner routing (not yet run; build-only follow-up):

1. On both a colony grid and an expedition, order a six-guard squad across 40–100 tiles with
   multiple wall corners, one-tile corridors, offset doors, barricades and dense trees. Repeat
   in reverse, from sub-tile spawn offsets and on a rotated grid. Check continuous corner
   turns, no wall penetration, arrival and resumed patrols after combat interruptions.
2. Trigger tactical flanks, retreats and radio approaches around the same corners, with moving
   targets and allies. Check that firing while travelling and native friendly separation remain.
3. Add/remove a blocking crate during travel. Confirm the route reconnects or reports blocked,
   retries without an endless wobble, and resumes when a route exists. Repeat through RMC water;
   native slowdown should still allow progress, while fire, space and hard banks remain blocked.
4. Record route/search timings with six guards receiving simultaneous long move orders and
   contact. Cell budgets remain bounded; runtime cost has not been measured for this change.

## Guard construction, contact response and field supplies follow-up

Travel/fire state no longer depends on a live steering component: a queued, stopped or failed
movement can still return fire. A blocked firing lane under pressure permits a deliberate short
peek; hits wake the next decision and the trigger executor. Utility actions, wielding, fire rate,
ammunition, visible aim points and friendly-fire checks remain authoritative.

Scavenging checks actual magazine-slot or ballistic compatibility and remaining ammunition. The
four-metre, five-second claim can include loose items, accessible floor storage and a dead body's
held items, inventory and one bag/belt layer. Living/critical bodies, locked storage, active grenades
and unknown ordnance are rejected. HE and smoke with known native behavior can be adopted, while the
existing squad throw budget remains unchanged. Pickups use hands and finite storage; a body/container
search takes 0.8 seconds and a loose pickup 0.25 seconds. Loaded guards replenish only while quiet and
without a travel order. No ammunition is fabricated or transferred from a living squadmate.

Members on the same move order pause for a laggard over eight metres away and over five metres
behind in progress. Each wait is capped at four seconds with a two-second interval. A member reporting
blocked travel for over twelve seconds keeps its own retries but cannot permanently hold the squad.
This is bounded cohesion assistance, not a guarantee of arrival through an unreachable map.

Manual verification for this revision (not run):

1. Spawn `cmu-expedition-ai here 6 mixed` on dirt and indoors. Wait thirty seconds: no mound or
   idle shovel work should start. Issue `cmu-expedition-orders here <squad> guard north`, then
   repeat east/south/west/auto and on a rotated grid. Check spaced native structures, their facing,
   an open rear/lateral escape, actual material consumption and one completed structure per order.
2. Fight from behind the new mound. Confirm outward bullets pass, incoming shots can penetrate
   according to native chance, and the AI does not treat the mound alone as safe medical shelter.
3. Shoot a squad mid-move, while queued and while stuck near a corner. Check prompt return fire,
   safe lane-clearing peeks, help report delivery and resumption of the retained order after contact.
4. Exhaust ammunition beside compatible/incompatible/full/empty magazines, shells, a dead body's
   backpack, a locked bag and a living/critical body. Check exclusive claims, finite pickup/reload,
   rejection of inaccessible items, storage capacity, timeout, possession and injury interruption.
   Repeat with native HE/smoke, active grenades and unsupported ordnance.
5. Rush from two or three directions with xenos/neomorphs, then enter smoke, die in view or retreat
   behind walls. Check target spread, immediate contact priority, escape spacing, short memory and
   no blind tracking/shooting. Use spit, slowing spit, spray and lingering acid; check feasible dodges,
   unsafe-ground escape and no crossing into another acid patch or through solid cover.
6. Order six/twelve guards past streetlights, traffic lights, furniture, trees and offset corners.
   Add/remove a blocker and separate one member. Check half-tile detours, bounded waits/retries,
   rejoining when possible and explicit blocked status when impossible. Repeat through RMC water
   and during combat; record navigation cost and frame time. Compilation is not runtime validation.

Barricade traversal and fire:

- Route searches admit unwired native `Climbable` surfaces. Movement approaches a clear
  starting point, validates the sweep to the surface origin, and calls `ClimbSystem.TryClimb`.
  Native delays, interaction restrictions, collision changes and wire/shutter checks apply.
  Orders, possession, incapacitation and damage cancel preparation. Failed climbs get an
  eight-second retry backoff and a route rebuild. Non-climbable folding barricades need a detour.
- Shooting and sight recognize low bullet cover separately from body collision. Both native
  directional blockers and CMU `BarricadeBlock` proximity/facing rules are considered.
  Partial cover permits small-arms fire; it does not guarantee a hit or certify medical shelter.
  Rocket lanes remain conservative. A blocked lane can trigger one bounded lateral advance
  per local squad when a short sidestep fails, without requiring nonexistent covering fire.
- Sandbag fixtures now use the same climb-compatible layers as other low barricades rather
  than full wall layers. This corrects native traversal for players as well as AI.

Manual verification for these changes (not run locally): order a squad across unwired metal
barricades, sandbags and platform corners from both sides, then repeat with wire, a closed
shutter, a blocked landing, a nearby friendly and a mid-action order/knockdown. Check detours
around deployed folding barricades and resumption of the original order. Fight humans behind
rotated, single and double rows of cover: verify return fire, limited lateral advances, real
projectile blocking, no friendly fire, and no shots through full walls or smoke. Record squad
navigation cost with six guards; compilation alone does not validate movement in game.
